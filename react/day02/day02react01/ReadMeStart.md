# Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

- react01 폴더는 react/day02 내용과 같아서 지움

- 이 명령들은 모두 package.json 파일의 script에 정의되어 있음

  - npm start
    
    Starts the development server.

  - npm run build
    
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  - npm test
    
    Starts the test runner.

  - npm run eject
    
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  - cd day02react01
  - npm start

Happy hacking!
